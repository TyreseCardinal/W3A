      Felis catus, commonly known as the domestic cat, is a small carnivorous mammal that has been a companion to humans
      for thousands of years. Belonging to the family Felidae, domestic cats are known for their agility, sharp
      retractable claws, and keen senses. They have a diverse range of coat colors and patterns, reflecting centuries of
      selective breeding.

      making them popular pets. Scientifically named Felis catus, these feline companions exhibit a wide range of
      behaviors, from playful antics to independent exploration. They have adapted well to various environments, living
      in homes, farms, and urban landscapes.
